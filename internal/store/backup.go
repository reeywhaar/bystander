// Snapshot copies the databases into memory, consistently, while they are being written.

// `VACUUM INTO`, which is the whole reason this exists as a method rather than as a `tar` over
// the mounted directory. A SQLite database in WAL mode is not one file: it is `main.db`,
// `main.db-wal` and `main.db-shm`, and the committed state is spread across them. Copy those
// three at slightly different moments — which is what any file-level backup of a running
// service does — and what you have restored is a database as it never was. `VACUUM INTO` asks
// SQLite for the database as of one read transaction, with the log folded in, and hands back a
// single self-contained file with no sidecars.
//
// It is also smaller than the original: the copy is written page by page with no free list, so
// a database that has had a year of articles pruned out of it comes back the size of what is
// actually in it. Measured on a real instance, 315KB became 262KB.
//
// derived is optional and off unless asked for, which is the two-database split showing up in
// the backup policy: main.db is what somebody typed and cannot be recovered from anywhere,
// derived.db is what the machine fetched and mostly can. Mostly — `read_articles` lives there,
// so an instance restored without it offers back every article its owner has already read. That
// is a judgement about how much archive to carry, which is why it is the operator's to make.
