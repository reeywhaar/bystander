// Package backup takes a copy of the databases and hands it to somewhere that keeps copies.
//
// # Why this program does it rather than something beside it
//
// It used to serve the archive instead: a listener of its own on :3000, answering GET /backup,
// with a sidecar container fetching it on a loop. That worked and cost an image of our own to
// build, publish and keep — and the loop could only ever be a timer, because a thing outside
// this process cannot know whether anything has been written since the last copy.
//
// Pushing inverts both. The image is somebody else's now — backio-agent takes an archive at
// POST /backup and handles encryption, naming, upload and retention — and the decision of
// *when* moves in here, where the answer is knowable. Nothing is sent while nothing has
// changed.
//
// # What "changed" means
//
// main.db, and only main.db. That is what somebody typed — accounts, feeds, tags, pages,
// settings — and the file that cannot be reconstructed from anywhere. derived.db is what the
// machine fetched and can mostly be rebuilt by one fetch cycle, so an hour in which the only
// writes were articles arriving is an hour with nothing worth sending. It travels *in* the
// archive when the operator asks for it; it does not decide whether one is made.
