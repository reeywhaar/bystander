/**
 * Holding one element still while something is open on top of it.
 *
 * A modal `<dialog>` does not stop the page behind it scrolling. `showModal()` puts the dialog
 * in the top layer and makes the rest of the document inert, which sounds like it should cover
 * this and does not: inertness is about focus and pointer *targeting*, not about the wheel.
 * Measured in Chromium, a wheel over the backdrop scrolls the page underneath by the full
 * delta, and so does a wheel inside a dialog that has reached the end of its own scroll.
 *
 * The same is true one level up. A dialog opened from inside another dialog leaves the first
 * one scrollable — it is inert to clicks and not to scrolling — so the thing somebody was
 * reading slides away behind the thing they just opened.
 *
 * Counted rather than set and unset, because two dialogs can be open at once and the inner one
 * closing must not hand the page back its scroll while the outer one is still up. Counting per
 * element rather than globally, because the page and each dialog are separate questions.
